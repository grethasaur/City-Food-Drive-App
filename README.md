# City-of-Edmonton-Food-Drive-App
This includes the Food Drive App. 
We are still doing finishing touches to the app like putting the blurb for the dashboard but we do have a working prediction model and map generator deployed.


## Overview
This Food Drive App is a project developed as part of the Community Work Integrated Learning program. It serves as a tool to facilitate and enhance food drive initiatives by predicting donation bag collection using a proprietary machine learning model. The app provides various functionalities for both organizers and community volunteers.

## Features

### Machine Learning Model
- **Prediction Engine**: The heart of the app, utilizing a custom-built machine learning model to predict the number of donation bags that will be collected based on user inputs (location, duration, route specifics, and household count).

### User Interface
- **Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard providing a comprehensive view of donation predictions, statistics, and user inputs.
- **Neighborhood Mapping**: A visual representation of neighborhoods to aid volunteers in planning and execution.
- **Data Collection Form**: Accessible through a link, allowing volunteers to input necessary data for prediction.

### User Access Levels
- **Organizers**: Have full access to all features, including the dashboard, prediction engine, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and data collected.

## Deployment
This app is currently hosted at [Link to App Deployment].

## Technologies Used
- Python (Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the frontend)
- Google Maps API (for neighborhood mapping)
- Machine Learning (for prediction)
