Some people mentioned they did not think we would be there that early: 11:30, it may result in more bags. A thank you card left in their mailbox may be nice...if donated by a business. Include a longer list of things the foodbank would like to see. 
So, I spoke to people getting food at a food bank and here are some things I learned from those in need:
1. Everyone donates Kraft Mac and Cheese in the box. They can rarely use it because it needs milk and butter which is hard to get from regular food banks.
2. Boxed milk is a treasure, as kids need it for cereal which they also get a lot of.
3. Everyone donates pasta sauce and spaghetti noodles.
4. They cannot eat all the awesome canned veggies and soup unless you put a can opener in too or buy pop tops.
5. Oil is a luxury but needed for Rice a-Roni which they also get a lot of.
6. Spices or salt and pepper would be a real Christmas gift.
7. Tea bags and coffee make them feel like you care.
8. Sugar and flour are treats.
9. They fawn over fresh produce donated by farmers and grocery stores.
10. Seeds are cool in Spring and Summer because growing can be easy for some.
11. They rarely get fresh meat.
12. Tuna and crackers make a good lunch.
13. Hamburger Helper goes nowhere without ground beef.
14. They get lots of peanut butter and jelly but usually not sandwich bread.
15. Butter or margarine is nice too.
16. Eggs are a real commodity.
17. Cake mix and frosting makes it possible to make a childÂ’s birthday cake.
18. Dishwashing detergent is very expensive and is always appreciated.
19. Feminine hygiene products are a luxury and women will cry over that.
20. Everyone loves Stove Top Stuffing..",1.0,67.0,30.0

156,Bearspaw Chapel,Gateway Stake,Lee Ridge Ward,2,1,14.0,60.0,No,"Several houses on our route had no soliciting signs or have been empty so that decreased the number of people who knew about it. Usually we do 2 routes but this year that wasn't possible.
Our suggestion for the future to promote it is to get city permission to put a couple of banners on the Whitemud and Yellowhead highway spread out on overpasses (at least 2 to 3 each) at least a week before the flyers are delivered. Also if we can get permission to put the lawn signs out on center meridians on busy streets (ours is 34st) then it would get the local community notified in advance. This would be facing both ways so it would get maximun visability. Maybe the lawn signs and looking after them could be a special assignmnet overseen by the coordinator of the ward. Would there be more contact and recruitment of ward members by assigning 2 families to work together to organize the food drive flyers etc?
Another idea is if there is a lack of routes filled can the missionaries help deliver some routes? Or an email going out to ask if anyone is up to taking on an additinal one?I know that we have the bulletin but sometimes there is so much i formation in there that I dont get to read it all the way through. A seperate email would be great to get the ward thknking about it maybe 6 to 4 weeks in advance. We feel badly that the extra routes we usually sign up for didn't seem to be done as we didn't see flyers or bags. This year we had several things happen that meant we couldn't realistically do more. I am sad that was the case. Those areas have donated generously in the past.
What about contacting the schools in our ward as well and asking to put a collection box at the office or recruiting families to help that way. Or doing a presentation to get kids helping deliver flyers after school with supervision by a couple of ward members. We could have done more pickups just not more flyers. I know my daughter's junior high has a point system so there is some friendly competition with bonus points if they do service.
I know our ward did get together this year with at least one community league and had a table at their event.....what about reaching out to other community leagues and making connections in the spring so it can be planned for in the fall? Other than social media like Facebook would there be sharable links for ward members or ways to promote the event in our community? My husband said he heard it on the radio. What about quick tv commercials promoting it during the local news the week before the food drive?
I am sure we could recruit volunteer donations of flyers or banners or radio time by companies. Or at least products given at a highly discounted cost. Maybe the youth could also design posters for their schools to promote the food drive. Another idea is what about collaborating with other religious organizations in the city to deliver flyers and collect donations? Maybe it could be tried with 1 or 2 different faiths next year and expand in the future to including more. I dont know how we would choose but there is much good in the hearts of our neighbors and friends to be made. I would also like to suggest that the stake and wards consider having a donation box at the church year round or at least at activities. Maybe not just for the food drive but for hygeine or sesonal items. There is much need in our community and it would be so lovely if we could encourage more service directly impacting our neighbors and community. This could also help keep our church members outwardly focused and be mindful of ways we can truly love one another.",1.0,147.0,90.0
